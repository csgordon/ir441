# ir441

This is the reference interpreter for the IR used in Drexel University's CS 441.

Recent builds for your platform of choice should be available under Releases.

The program, ```ir441```, assumes program text is passed from standard input.

- To run it on a canned ```.ir``` file, you can use ```ir441 < myfile.ir```
- To run it directly on the output of your compiler, you can use ```mycomp input.441 | ir441```

There are additional flags to the program which are described in the assignment handouts, but for quick reference you can run ```ir441 --help``` to get a quick list.
